MARKETCHECK_API_KEY=your_marketcheck_api_key

# 2. Test it:
python test_marketcheck.py
```

# Run the main app

## Architecture Benefits

Even with limited sources currently active, the architecture provides:
- **Scalability**: New sources activate automatically when APIs available
- **Resilience**: System continues working even when sources fail
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new sources or update existing ones
- **Performance**: Parallel searching when multiple sources active

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Add MARKETCHECK_API_KEY to enable Cars.com
2. **Short-term**: Monitor and update sources as their APIs become available
3. **Long-term**: Consider partnerships with Autobytel and CarsDirect

The system is fully prepared to handle all 16 sources - they will activate automatically as access is restored or API keys are added.
