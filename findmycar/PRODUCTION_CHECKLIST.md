# Production Deployment Checklist ✅

## Critical Security Requirements

### ✅ Environment Variables & Configuration
- [ ] Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` in production

- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Rollback plan ready
- [ ] Deployment documented

### ✅ Post-Deployment
- [ ] All health checks passing
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Performance metrics baseline established
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Compliance & Legal

### ✅ Data Protection

- [ ] GDPR compliance implemented (if applicable)
- [ ] Data export/deletion capabilities
- [ ] User consent mechanisms
- [ ] Data encryption at rest and in transit

### ✅ Business Continuity

- [ ] Compliance requirements met

## Quick Verification Commands

### Check Configuration
```bash
# Validate configuration
python config_validator.py

# Check environment variables
env | grep -E "(ENVIRONMENT|DEBUG|SECRET_KEY|ALLOWED_)"
```

### Test Security
```bash
# Run security tests
python test_production_ready.py

# Check for secrets in code
grep -r "SECRET\|PASSWORD\|KEY" . --include="*.py" | grep -v "your-"

# Verify CORS settings
curl -H "Origin: https://evil.com" https://yourapp.com/api/stats
```

### Test Performance
```bash
# Health check
curl https://yourapp.com/health

# Load test (example)
ab -n 100 -c 10 https://yourapp.com/

# Database performance
docker exec postgres pg_stat_activity
```

### Verify Monitoring
```bash
# Check logs
tail -f logs/cargpt.log

# Test error tracking
curl https://yourapp.com/nonexistent-page

# Verify metrics
curl https://yourapp.com/api/stats
```

## Emergency Procedures

### If Compromised
1. Immediately change all passwords and API keys
2. Review access logs for suspicious activity
3. Rotate JWT secrets
4. Update security patches
5. Notify users if data may be compromised

### If Down
1. Check health endpoints
2. Review error logs
3. Verify database connectivity
4. Check Redis connectivity
5. Restart application services
6. Use rollback plan if necessary

### If Slow Performance
1. Check database query performance
2. Verify Redis cache hit rates
3. Review application metrics
4. Check system resources
5. Scale horizontally if needed

**IMPORTANT**: This checklist should be completed before any production deployment. Each item should be verified and signed off by the appropriate team member.
