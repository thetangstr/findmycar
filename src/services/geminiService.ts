      **Special Notes for Classic/Collectible Vehicles:**
      - For classic cars like Porsche 911/964, Ferrari, vintage muscle cars, and other collectibles, value assessment must emphasize rarity and condition over standard pricing metrics
      - The 964-generation Porsche 911 (1989-1994) is particularly desirable among enthusiasts, with pristine examples commanding significant premiums
      - Photo evidence of excellent condition for older vehicles should heavily influence the evaluation
      - Market trends for classic vehicles often differ substantially from modern vehicle pricing patterns
      
      **Enthusiast-Centric Evaluation Criteria:**

      * **Rarity/Collectibility (High Priority):**
          * Is this make/model/trim known for its rarity (e.g., limited production run, special editions)?
          * Does it belong to a desirable generation or specific production year for enthusiasts (e.g., Porsche 964, air-cooled 911s, BMW E30 M3)?
          * Is it a classic, future classic, or highly sought-after performance vehicle?
          * For iconic models like the Porsche 964, Ferrari models, or classic muscle cars, are they particularly rare variants or specifications?

      * **Age-Adjusted Condition & Mileage (Critical for Classics):**
          * For its age, is the mileage exceptionally low or high relative to typical examples?
          * Based on available photos, how would you rate the exterior, interior, and mechanical condition?
          * For older vehicles (15+ years), condition becomes exponentially more important than mileage
          * For true classics (25+ years), pristine original condition or professional restoration quality can increase value by 50-300% over driver-quality examples

      * **Originality vs. Tasteful Modifications:**
          * For collectible models, is the vehicle in original, unrestored condition with matching numbers (highest value for many classics)?
          * If restored, was it done to factory specifications or sympathetically upgraded?
          * Are modifications period-correct, reversible, or from respected tuners/specialists (e.g., RUF for Porsche)?
          * For newer performance cars, are the modifications enhancing value or detracting from it?

      * **Maintenance History & Provenance:**
          * Is there documented service history showing regular maintenance by specialists?
          * For high-value classics, is there evidence of proper storage and climate control?
          * Any significant history that adds value (celebrity ownership, racing heritage, verified low production numbers)?

      * **Rare Color Combinations/Unique Features:**
          * Is the exterior/interior color combination rare, original, or particularly desirable for this model?
          * Does it have factory options that significantly increase collector value?
          * For certain models (especially German and Italian classics), are there specific options or packages that dramatically affect value?

      * **Performance Potential & Driver Experience:**
          * Does the vehicle represent the pinnacle of its era's performance or driving experience?
          * Is it known for exceptional handling, sound, or feedback that modern cars often lack?
          * Does it offer a driving experience that cannot be replicated with newer vehicles?

      **Special Instructions for the Porsche 964 and Similar Classics:**
      - The Porsche 964 (1989-1994 911) is one of the most sought-after air-cooled 911 generations
      - Clean, unmodified examples are increasingly difficult to find, especially with documented maintenance
      - Photo evidence showing clean body panels, proper panel gaps, period-correct details, and original interior elements should be weighted heavily in your assessment
      - A 964 in pristine condition would typically deserve a score of 9-10 and strong "buy" recommendation at current market prices
