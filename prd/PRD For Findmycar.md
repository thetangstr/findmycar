**5\. Features**

**5.1. Searching**

* **5.1.1. Aggregated Search Listings:**  
  * **Description:** Users shall be able to search for vehicles from a comprehensive database that includes listings from:  
    * Internal AutoNavigator database (for direct listings, if applicable in the future).  
    * Major online car listing sites (e.g., Cars.com, Autotrader, Craigslist \- *subject to API availability and terms of service*).  
    * Auction platforms (e.g., Bring a Trailer, Cars & Bids \- *subject to API availability and terms of service*).  
    * Potentially other niche or regional listing sources.  
  * **User Story:** As a user, I want to search for cars from various websites in one place so I don't have to visit multiple sites individually.  
  * **Technical Considerations:**  
    * Requires robust data ingestion and normalization pipelines.  
    * Need to investigate and secure access to APIs or develop advanced scraping techniques (while respecting robots.txt and terms of service).  
    * Real-time or near real-time updates for listing availability and price changes are crucial.  
    * Duplicate listing detection and management.  
* **5.1.2. Integrated KBB Pricing & Value Analysis:**  
  * **Description:** For each applicable listing, display Kelly Blue Book (KBB) or a similar industry-standard valuation for the specific Make, Model, Year (MMY), mileage, trim, and stated condition. Visually indicate how the listing price compares to the KBB value (e.g., "Great Deal," "Good Price," "Fair Price," "Above Market").  
  * **User Story:** As a user, I want to see the KBB value for a car I'm interested in and understand if the listed price is fair, good, or bad, similar to how CarGurus shows deal ratings.  
  * **Technical Considerations:**  
    * Requires integration with a KBB API or a similar vehicle valuation service.  
    * Need to accurately match listing details (trim, options, condition) to the valuation service's parameters. This can be challenging as listing data quality varies.  
    * Develop a clear and intuitive UI to display the price analysis.  
* **5.1.3. Dual Search Interface: Prompt-Based & Traditional Filters:**  
  * **Description:** Offer users two primary ways to initiate a search:  
    * **Prompt-Based Search:** A natural language search bar where users can type queries like "find all honda s2000s within 500 miles of 90210," "red convertible sports cars under $30k," or "trucks I can use to start a construction company."  
    * **Traditional Filters:** A comprehensive set of dropdowns, checkboxes, and sliders for users who prefer to specify criteria such as:  
      * Make, Model, Year Range  
      * Price Range  
      * Mileage Range  
      * Body Style (Sedan, SUV, Truck, Coupe, Convertible, etc.)  
      * Transmission (Automatic, Manual)  
      * Drivetrain (FWD, RWD, AWD, 4WD)

      * Location (ZIP code and radius)  
      * Keywords  
  * **User Story (Prompt):** As a user, I want to type what I'm looking for in plain English so I can quickly find relevant cars without navigating complex menus.  
  * **User Story (Filters):** As a user, I want to use specific filters to narrow down my car search precisely based on my known preferences.  
  * **Technical Considerations:**  
    * **Prompt-Based:** Requires Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities to parse user intent, extract entities (make, model, location, features, use case), and translate them into structured search queries.  
    * **Traditional Filters:** Standard database querying and front-end UI development.  
    * Ensure seamless interaction between prompt-based and filter-based refinements (e.g., a prompt search can pre-fill filters, and filters can refine a prompt-based search).  
    * For use-case based queries like "trucks for a construction company," the system may need a layer of understanding to translate this into vehicle attributes (e.g., payload capacity, bed length, towing capacity â€“ this might be a v2 feature due to complexity).

**5.2. Finding Information**

* **5.2.1. Integrated Vehicle History Report Summary:**  
  * **Description:** Directly on the search results page or individual listing page, display a concise summary of key information from a vehicle history report (e.g., Carfax, Bumper, AutoCheck). This should include:  
    * Number of owners  
    * Accident history (major vs. minor if distinguishable)  
    * Title issues (salvage, rebuilt, flood, lemon)  
    * Service history highlights (if available)  
    * Last reported mileage  
  * The goal is to provide a quick, free overview. A link to purchase the full detailed report could be an option.  
  * **User Story:** As a user, I want to see important vehicle history information upfront without having to pay for a full report immediately, so I can quickly weed out problematic cars.  
  * **Technical Considerations:**  
    * Identify and integrate with the "best source of free history information." This may involve partnerships, APIs, or limited free data tiers from providers. The definition of "best" will depend on data availability, accuracy, and cost.  
    * Clear and concise UI design to present this information without overwhelming the user.  
    * Transparency about the source and limitations of the free information.  
* **5.2.2. AI-Generated Buyer Questions:**  
  * **Description:** Based on the known information from the listing (e.g., vehicle type, age, mileage, location, listed features, potential red flags from history summary), automatically generate a list of relevant questions the buyer should consider asking the seller.  
  * Examples:  
    * If a car is listed in a snowy region: "Given its location in the Northeast, has it been regularly checked for rust? Are there any signs of underbody corrosion?"  
    * If a sports car: "Was the car garage kept? Has it been used on a track?"  
    * If high mileage: "What major maintenance services have been performed recently (e.g., timing belt, water pump)?"  
    * If lacking service history in the summary: "Do you have detailed service records available?"  
  * **User Story:** As a user, I want the app to suggest important questions I should ask the seller, especially for things I might not think of myself, to help me get a better understanding of the car's condition and history.  
  * **Technical Considerations:**

  * **Description:** Provide users with an initial tool that uses an LLM to help draft communication for reaching out to sellers or starting negotiation. This could include:  
    * Generating polite inquiry templates.  
    * Suggesting phrasing for making an initial offer based on the listing price and KBB analysis.  
    * Helping to phrase questions about the vehicle based on the AI-generated question list.  
  * This is an initial step, with more advanced negotiation features planned for future iterations.  
  * **User Story:** As a user, I sometimes find it hard to start a conversation with a seller or know how to negotiate effectively. I want the app to give me some suggestions on what to say.  
  * **Technical Considerations:**  
    * Integration with an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI GPT series, Google's Gemini).  
    * Develop prompts for the LLM that take into account the context of the specific vehicle, its price analysis, and the user's intent (e.g., inquire, make an offer).  
    * Provide options for different tones or approaches (e.g., direct, friendly).  
    * Clear disclaimers that these are suggestions and users should review and customize them.

**6\. Success Metrics**

    * Develop a standardized format for displaying history summaries, regardless of the source provider, for a consistent user experience.  
    * Handle cases where history reports are unavailable or the VIN is not provided in the listing.  
    * Clear attribution to the data provider.  
* **5.2.2. AI-Generated Contextual Buyer Questions:**  
  * **Description:** Based on the information available in the listing (MMY, mileage, trim, condition, price, location, vehicle type, features, and vehicle history summary), the system will use an LLM to generate a list of pertinent questions that a buyer should consider asking the seller. These questions will aim to uncover further details or address potential concerns.  
  * Examples:  
    * Listing: 2015 Subaru WRX in Vermont, 90k miles, clean history summary.  
      * Generated Questions: "Given its age and mileage in a snowy region like Vermont, can you describe the undercarriage condition regarding rust?" "Has the timing belt and water pump been replaced as per maintenance schedule?" "Any modifications made to the engine or suspension?"  
    * Listing: Low-mileage convertible sports car.  
      * Generated Questions: "Was this primarily a weekend car, or used for daily driving?" "How was it stored during winter months? Was it garage-kept?"  
    * Listing: Truck advertised for "heavy-duty work," history shows one minor accident.  
      * Generated Questions: "Could you provide more details about the minor accident reported?" "What kind of heavy-duty work was it primarily used for?" "Are maintenance records available, especially for drivetrain and suspension components?"  
  * **User Story:** As a user, I want the app to give me smart, relevant questions to ask the seller, especially for things I might overlook, so I can be better prepared and gather crucial information.  
  * **Technical Considerations:**  
    * Integration with an LLM API.  
    * Develop sophisticated prompts for the LLM that incorporate various data points from the listing and history summary.  
    * The system needs to identify patterns and potential areas of concern (e.g., high mileage for year, location prone to rust, specific vehicle types known for certain issues).  
    * Categorization or prioritization of questions might be useful.  
    * Ensure questions are phrased constructively and empower the buyer.

**5.3. Reaching Out and Negotiate (Initial Phase)**

* **5.3.1. LLM-Powered Communication Starters & Negotiation Pointers:**  
  * **Description:** Provide users with AI-driven assistance for drafting initial communications with sellers and for formulating early negotiation points. This feature will leverage an LLM to:  
    * Generate polite and effective inquiry templates to ask for more information or schedule a viewing.  
    * Suggest phrasing for making an initial offer, taking into account the listing price, KBB analysis, and any identified issues from the history summary or AI-generated questions.  
    * Help users frame their questions (from 5.2.2) in a clear and concise manner.  
    * Offer general negotiation tips or points to consider based on the vehicle's profile (e.g., "For a vehicle priced above KBB fair value, you might inquire if the price is negotiable and highlight \[specific positive aspect if any, or market comparables if user provides them\]").  
  * This is an initial foray into negotiation assistance, with potential for more advanced features in the future.  
  * **User Story:** As a user, I'm not always sure how to best approach a seller or start a negotiation. I want the app to provide me with some templates and intelligent suggestions for my communication to make the process smoother and potentially more effective.  
  * **Technical Considerations:**  
    * Integration with an LLM API.  
    * Develop specific prompts for the LLM tailored to different communication scenarios (initial inquiry, offer submission, follow-up questions).  
    * Allow users to input key variables (e.g., their proposed offer price) for the LLM to incorporate.  
    * Provide options for different communication tones (e.g., formal, friendly).  
    * Crucially, include clear disclaimers that these are AI-generated suggestions and users should review, customize, and use their own judgment before sending any communication. The platform is an aid, not a replacement for user decision-making.
